# Youtube Video Player (branch name : ***Second branch***)
#### This is an application thet playes videos from Youtube. We need to use the YouTube API that Google provide to make this happen and we also have to create an API key using our gmail account. 

## Steps to set up YouTube API
#### 1. Download or setup the following Items
|Activity|Link|
|--------|--------|
|YouTube API download|https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/downloads|
|API key creation|https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=youtube-video-player-321812&folder=&organizationId=|


#### 2. After Doing this clone the repository and check out the **"Second Branch"** (This can be done inside Android Studio by using the git option at the bottom right of the screen)

#### 3. Locate the 'YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar* file' and copy it
#### 4. Paste the youtube api jat file in the 'libs' section of the android studio project folder.(The only step that remains is getting the api key and using it in the code)
